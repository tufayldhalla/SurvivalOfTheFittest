# SurvivalOfTheFittest

Created a variated and enhanced version of the Cops and Robbers and Maze Runner game on Java. Employed various difficulty levels and maze maps to create a challenging game

The object of the game is to run through the maze and collect all the keys to open the jail cell and collect the gold coin to continue on to the next maze. Also, you have to try to avoid getting caught by the cops or you lose a life!
